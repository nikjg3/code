# The Perfect Lil' Bot

This bot example is the combined work of members of the Discord.js and Idiot Guide's community.
It attempts to provide a "complete" starter example of a simple, one-file bot, with comments and
information to properly understand each part and how it works.

[Want a more advanced tutorial that's not just copy/pasting code? Check out AnIdiots.Guide](https://anidiots.guide/)

> **Important Note: This example code is just that - an example - it's not meant as a bot you can just use without any further action. If you do not know javascript, please go learn it first before trying to make a bot or use this code. If you don't want to learn, or don't have time to, then don't use this code, go get a good bot instead. I suggest [Skyra](https://skyra.pw/) as it has everything you need in it!**

## Setup

> Before doing any of this make sure you have a bot account, check [this page](https://anidiots.guide/first-bot/your-first-bot) to know how to create the bot app and your token, as well as how to invite the bot in your guild.

- Create a new folder somewhere, give it a bot name, aka `MyBot` or `SuperBot`
- Create a file called `index.js`, and paste in the contents of index.js below.
- Create a file called `config.json` and give it the following content, using your real bot token:
```json
{ 
  "token"  : "MTg-this-IzNzU3OTA5NjA-is.not-DCeFB-a.real-r4DQlO-t0ken-qerT0",
  "prefix" : "+"
}
```

You then need to run a couple of things to make this work. Those things are run in console, which
can be opened by using `SHIFT+Right-Click` in your folder, and selected `Open command prompt here`
(your version of windows might say "PowerShell", don't worry it'll work fine!). In console, use
the following commands:

> Make sure you install the correct version of discord.js for the correct code version you're using.

```
npm init -y
// FOR VERSION 11:
npm install discord.js@11.6.3
// FOR VERSION 12:
npm install discord.js@latest
node index.js
```

If you've done things right, that should start the bot.
